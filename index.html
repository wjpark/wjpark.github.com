          IDEO for a Financial Client, 2011
        </div>
        <div class="summary push_1 grid_10">
            Our client thought he hired us to build an iPad app for the lower to middle class customers of his prepaid
            debit card. But what we quickly realized was that the entire customer journey had to be unpacked,
            understood, and transformed to deliver on the company’s aspiration to be the Southwest Airlines of
            banking: simple, trustworthy, and value-driven.
          <p>
            We brought to life several concepts that spanned across this journey. Every single idea had to
            embody and reinforce those three key attributes to build awareness and subsequent loyalty&#8212; from the
            packaging to the account holder’s homepage, our ideas complemented each other, but were also
            impactful alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, we had to design around elements over which we had
            little control. Through extensive channel visits, user research, and iteration, we ensured our concepts
            made sense within the broader retail and financial context. For instance, we created bold packaging to draw
            attention on a crowded rack. We also investigated mechanisms and applications that went
            beyond supporting basic financial transactions to ones that addressed the financial aspirations of the
            customers.

            FourSquare API, I display the Top 10 locations based on trending check-in data.

          IDEO for Stadium Operator Client, 2010
        </div>
        <div class="summary push_4 grid_10">
          With hi-def TVs and home theater systems in more and more living rooms, sports fans are finding fewer reasons to attend live games and more excuses to stay on the couch. A family outing is often too expensive, inconvenient and uncomfortable to be worth the hassle.
          <p>
          Our client, a national food and beverage operator, wanted us to bring to life ideas that refreshed and elevated the fan experience at the proposed new $1 billion San Francisco 49ers stadium.
          </p>
          <p>
          Our team visualized services that revolved around the unique passion of Bay Area foodies and devout 49ers fans.We designed around both mass and premium food moments throughout game day, from parking lot tailgating to luxury box multi-course meals.

          Mobile ESPN, 2005
        </div>
        <div class="summary push_1 grid_10">
          Mobile ESPN constituted ESPN’s foray into the wireless space. Specifically geared toward the sports fanatic, this premium service merged basic communication capabilities with exclusive sports and entertainment content.
          <p>
            As part of the core launch team, I strived to exceed organizational and fan expectations at every touchpoint, including handsets, accessories,
            and billing.
          </p>
          <p>
            When it came to the handset packaging, I believed it was crucial to re-think the prototypical industry egg carton box. Such casing was certainly functional, but too ubiquitous and generic to properly communicate the distinct value proposition of the Mobile ESPN brand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The form factor for the packaging we developed was inspired by a cigar box, and the material for the red in-mold was chosen to feel like the inside of a football helmet. It was also designed to minimize manufacturing and kitting costs.
